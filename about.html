	<p> I am a senior at Damien High School, I am 17 years old. I play soccer and enjoy to go to the gym after school. I am president of the student section at Damien, as president i try to get everyone to come out and support the athletic teams. I really like to challenge myself in school and take the hardest classes I can in hope to learn something new. I play soccer for one of the top teams in the country and travel the country playing soccer. I plan on applying to a lot of colleges out of state with my top schools located in Washington, Chicago, and Colorado. I do not plan on continuing soccer as I want to go to college for education and enjoy my time there.  </p>
	<p> College List: Seattle University, Loyola University of Chicago, Santa Clara University, University of San Diego, San Diego State University, Gonzaga, University Colorado Boulder, University of Washington, and Boise State University
