	<p>Welcome to my website, my name is Alec Sarrail, I am a senior at Damien High School. I enjoy to stay involved arund campus as I am the leader of our student section, a 3 year varsity soccer player and a decent student. I have traveled around the country playing competitive soccer since I was 13 years old. I have won numerous prestige tournaments: including Surf Cup, National Cup, Albion Cup and Far west regionals in Idaho. After high school I plan on attending a four-year university most likely out of state to study economics. I hope one day to pursue a job in taking over my moms business as the number one toy reseller in the western half of the United States.   </p>
